	  <p>AI Sentience, where AI begins developing human brain capabilities, has been a concept ever since the introduction of technology. AI Sentience very widespread, appearing in movies such as Avengers Age of Ultron, Chappie, I-Robot, etc… As AI have become more and more efficient, people have begun to speculate about the benefits or the downfall that AI Sentience could bring to civilization. <br><br>Benefits of AI Sentience:<br><br>AI sentience would be beneficial to the population because of the increased capabilities and efficiencies that it would bring, but it would also hurt the human race because of unemployment and a robot takeover. AI sentience would allow for an increase in production because of the increased time that they can run, and increased quantity and quality of items able to be produced. This would allow for a fully efficient economy because of better use of time, technology, quantity, and quality of resources.<br><br>Drawbacks of AI Sentience:<br><br> Although having a fully efficient economy would be great, replacing people with AI would have some drawbacks. First, robots are not as capable of handling unexpected situations. Second, robots replacing human jobs would greatly increase the unemployment rate. Third, a businesses return on investment would suffer depending on the amount of tasks at hand. Finally, it can cause an overall loss in production if something malfunctions because if one thing goes wrong, then everything requires troubleshooting. AI Sentience could also lead to the downfall of humanity. Because with human brain capabilities, a robot could develop ways to create more robots and bypass all safety restrictions that were put on them–basically creating a robot dictatorship over all of humanity.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Essentially, if humanity were to develop AI sentience, we would have improved economic production at the cost of unemployment and the possible doom of the human race because of the ever improving capabilities of technology.
