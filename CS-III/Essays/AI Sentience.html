          <h1>AI Sentience</h1>
	  <hr/>
	  
	  <p>AI Sentience, where AI begins developing human brain capabilities, has been a concept ever since the introduction of technology. This concept is also very widespread, appearing in movies such as Avengers Age of Ultron, Chappie, I-Robot, etc… As AI has become more and more efficient, people have begun to speculate about the benefits or the downfall that AI Sentience could bring because of the current capabilities of robots. AI sentience would be beneficial to the population because of the increased capabilities and efficiencies that it would bring, but it would also hurt the human race because of unemployment and a robot takeover. AI sentience would allow for an increase in production because of the increased time that they can run, and increased quantity and quality of items able to be produced. This would allow for a fully efficient economy because of better use of time, technology, quantity, and quality of resources. Although having a fully efficient economy would be great, replacing people with AI would have some drawbacks. First, robots are not as capable of handling unexpected situations. Second, robots replacing human jobs would greatly increase the unemployment rate. Third, a businesses return on investment would suffer depending on the amount of tasks at hand. Finally, it can cause an overall loss in production if something malfunctions because if one thing goes wrong, then everything requires troubleshooting. AI Sentience could also lead to the downfall of humanity. Because being sentient means having human brain capabilities, a robot could develop ways to create more robots and bypass all safety restrictions that were put on them–basically creating a robot dictatorship over all of humanity. In all cases that humans try to stop what is happening, nothing is able to be done unless every last robot were to be wiped out because if there is one robot, it can produce another robot. If something of this caliber were to occur, humanity would be doomed because of the constantly improving technology that would ultimately benefit robots. Essentially, if humanity were to develop AI sentience, we would have improved economic production at the cost of unemployment and the possible doom of the human race.
