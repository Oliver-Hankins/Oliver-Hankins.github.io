	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I struggled a lot on creating multiple users this week, I haven't gotten very far, however I created a few basic frameworks for the accounts of students and teachers. I will keep on researching solutions, however I think that our group is on to something with the selection of using flask.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I dealt with a big tennis tournament in Waco this week. It is one of the biggest tournaments that texas has through the whole spring season, and it is right before the state tournament. I also dealt with some sickness this week, so I was away from my group for the most part.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I did not have any interpersonal challenges this week.</p>
