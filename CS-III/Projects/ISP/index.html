	  <h2>The Concept</h2>
	  <hr size="2" width="69%">
	  <p>Attendance in schools has alwasys been a time consumer for teachers and students. Because of this, my group and I came up with an idea that could revolutionize the way that teachers take attendance. Our idea is to create a software that compares faces to a database when a person walks into a class, marking a person present if they are seen by the camera, and marking them absent if they are not seen by the time that the bell rings. This project would benefit schools by taking away the necessity for a teacher to take attendance, ultimately giving teachers more time to run their class and taking away the chance that attendnace can be messed up. </p>
