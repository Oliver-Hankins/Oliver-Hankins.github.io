	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>We have had issues with the way that we upload our pictures into the file that we use for testing. Sometimes the picture does not actually register as a photo and it messes up our function that checks for and identifies people's faces.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>A few of our members, including me, are in extracurricular activities like sports, band, etc... So this past week, we haven't had much time as a group to sit down and really work on the project. It is usually only one or two of us at a time that can work on the project.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>There have not been any interpersonal challenges.</p>
