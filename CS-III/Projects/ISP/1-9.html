	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Because it is so early in our project's development, we have not really had any technical challenges. The only issues we really had was getting everybody to be organized and on the same page with the github and how our project is to go.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I think that in terms of scheduling, our team has had a habit of being too optimistic, saying that we can finish certain ideas in short times that might not be manageable. This is good that we are being so creative and optimistic, but I think that we should take a step back and communicate our schedules.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I think that the only real interpersonal challenge that we have had so far is that sometimes we lose focus as a group and just begin socializing, rather than staying focussed for the entire time that we are supposed to be working.</p>
