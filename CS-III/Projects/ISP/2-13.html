	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>One of our slightly smaller issues is that we can't figure out a theme of the website that we want to use. This has lead to lots of extra work on our frontend. Although it is slightly inconvenient, we are working it out. A bigger issue however is still figuring out the API. Although it is a big issue, we have made slight progress on the development of our API, like getting the basic framework of the program down.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I had another tournament this week, so it took away a 2 day period in which I could've been working more on our project.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I have not had any interpersonal challenges with any of the other members.</p>
