	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>This week, we attempted to put up our database, we tried using SQL, but could not get it up unless we bought a service.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I had a national high school tennis tournament that lasted from Wednesday until Saturday in which we got 4th place in the nation. This tournament took up a lot of time and energy and ultimately took away from my ability to assist a lot on our project.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I have not had any interpersonal challenges so far.</p>
