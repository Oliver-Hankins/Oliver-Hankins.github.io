	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>William and I worked on creating a database for student profiles, e.g. their name, face, id, etc... One thing that we had a lot of issues with and still haven't solved is the issue of displaying a video on the html page. Another issue that we have had is getting the functions for the database to find specific photos.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I could not ever find time this week to work together as a big group because I had a lot of extra tennis because I am preparing for the state tournament in tennis. I could only find time on my own to work on the project.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I have not had any interpersonal challenges this week other than the fact that some people don't really care that much about the project because it won't affect them that much.</p>
