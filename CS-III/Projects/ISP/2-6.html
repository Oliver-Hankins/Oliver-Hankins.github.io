	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>The biggest challenge for our group at the moment is the creation of the API. We are inexperienced when it comes to API's with the only experience that we have being CS3's connection of an API to the model scheduler that we used for last years scheduling app. This issue is very relevant because our ISP is pretty much run from a database because we will need to have a database of people's profiles and a database of attendance.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>My biggest scheduling challenges come with the fact that I am having to play a school tennis tournament every single week and in turn I am missing lots of class which puts me behind in everything. This is a big issue considering that I am constantly behind on computer science and other classes and spend most of my time catching up on work, rather than working ahead and tweaking my work on the project.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I have not had any interpersonal challenges. Everyone has done work so far.</p>
