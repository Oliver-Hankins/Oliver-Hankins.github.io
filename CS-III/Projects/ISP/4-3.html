	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>There were some complications with the new way to link css files on our project with the new login/signup systems. There's a new syntax that we have to use because we are using flask. In order to solve this issue, we had to use an entire different folder named "static" and put all of the functions and css files (ex: index.js or dashboard.css) and we had to use a url_for command inside of our html files to connect the css to the main files. Another issue that is going on is when William and I created our flask servers, we did them 2 different ways, so we are working to integrate all of our work into the same area so that they both work and our project can keep on progressing.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Some scheduling challenges that we have as a group is that typically when some people are able to work, others are not able to work, leading to us not being able to help each other as much as we nomally could in the same environment. This is a little inconvenient, however it is not a major issue considering we can just use google or other members for help whenever we get super stuck.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>There are a few members of the group who have not really worked that much on our project. Something that William, Cameron, and I started doing was just assigning them with the simple work that is just a little tedious, like moving all of our html and css files into the static and website folders so that the entire project can start working on a website. It feels like some people really don't feel a sense of urgency despite how close the website is, although it doesn't really matter because we pretty much have the project on schedule</p>
