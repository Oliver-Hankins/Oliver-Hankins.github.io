	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>We figured out that we could use SQL lite in order to host our database. Some issues that we are having so far with the program include our formatting, and storing data for later uses. I am personally struggling with figuring out how to make accounts that can be accessed through our database rather than locally.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>This week, I had another tournament and we had the school SAT on Wednesday that both took away from my class time and time at home that I could've used to work on the project. This is alright because we are now on Spring Break which will give me a full week in which I can work and progress on our project with minimal disruptions.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>I have not had any issues with any of my group members with the exception of our frontend constantly changing the themes of our project. It is not a large issue, just a slight inconvenience to consistently be changing the html and css of my assigned section on the frontend.</p>
