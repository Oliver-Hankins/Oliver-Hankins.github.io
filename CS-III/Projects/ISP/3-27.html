	  <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Beginning with using flask was relatively difficult for me, however after a little bit of research, I was able to get the hang of it. I also had issues with running a website because I forgot to clear my cache and had a few spelling errors in my code that I could not find for a long time.</p>
	  <h3>Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>This week I had my district tournament for tennis, which is my last tournament of the year, but it took up a full 2 days from the week and a lot of energy, which took away a decent portion of time that I could have used to work on the ISP.</p>
	  <h3>Interpersonal Challenges</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>There are a few members of the group who's work is not very significant, however, it seems like people are beginning to pick up some of the slack of our project.</p>
