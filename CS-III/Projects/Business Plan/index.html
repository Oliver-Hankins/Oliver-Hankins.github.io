	  <h3>Classroom Attendence using Facial Recognition</h3>

	  <h3>Context</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>In our Computer Science class, we were given the task of coming together to make our own project over the next few months. After a few classes of brainstorming about what would benefit the world in its current state, we decided that we could utilize software, electrical, and mechanical engineering in order to create a program that uses facial recognition to aid a teacher in taking attendance for their class.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Identity</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Use facial recognition for school attendance, thus teachers will not have to manually report attendance which will minimize false tardies.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Problem</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Many teachers struggle with getting attendance on time, as well as it taking away at least 2-3 minutes from valuable class time. Over the whole school year, that would come out to a total loss of 6 - 9 instructional hours for an everyday class, and 3 - 6 instructional hours for an every-other-day class.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Solution</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Create an algorithm and physical form for the program to be used in classrooms, offices, or other environments who wish to purchase the product.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Target Market</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>The target audience for a Facial recognition-based Attendance system would be primarily schools, however, a smaller audience exists for business and groups that may need to track attendance in a building or certain area.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Competition</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Many facial recognition systems exist on a large scale, such as Timeero, Jubble, and Fareclock. However, these companies only work towards our goal to an extent, they are all used for clocking in to work by taking a picture of yourself, this creates a manual responsibility for the people and could be easy to forget.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Revenue Streams</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Our products will be sold directly to customers using the website.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Marketing Activities</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>We will advertise on select websites, technology conventions, direct emails and ads to school districts.</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Expenses</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>Price to build the physical body<br>Price for shipping<br>Price for advertisements</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Team and Key Roles</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>With three members: one team member will be given the responsibility of creating an AI with the ability to recognize and remember faces, one person will have to work on connecting the camera that see the faces with the program, and the third person will have to work giving the AI eyes, allowing it so see and recognize faces. All positions can have additional people as well as gaps that are not yet discovered. (One member will have to test and configure the AI to recognize regardless of a hat,glasses, or other facial changes that can occur from day to day).</p>
	  <br>
	  <h3>Milestones</h3>
	  <br>
	  <p>As designs and production come close to finishing, the announcement will be made on select advertising platforms to people who have enough power to possibly try to implement our product into the classroom.</p>
