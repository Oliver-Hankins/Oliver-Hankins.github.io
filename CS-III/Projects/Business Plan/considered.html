	    1. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/bo-hong-chen/Digital%20Portfolio/webshop/plan.html">Boden Chen's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because of its noticeable convenience for front-end developers. Today, I think this would take away a lot of the necessity for a UI design team as the html and css would be easily utilized. Furthermore, businesses would be more willing to buy this product because it would take away certain complications when it comes to their products. <br><br>I chose to reject this project because I think it would be very similar to the program "Wix", therefore taking away from my desire to create a UI helper. I also don't think that html and css are that complicated, thus I don't think that a UI helper would assist much in creating a website.

	    2. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Brett Kaplan's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because of the current problem of students not being able to get through school lunch lines during the given lunch period. School lunch is chaotic, being that there are people who cut and the lunch lines also just taking forever to get someone there food. I think this product would help quicken the process of getting a student lunch so that they can eat during the school day.<br><br> I chose to reject this proposal because I do not think the school would follow through with it as the online ordering and pickup system would come with many complications, such as people mixing up what they ordered, people taking food that they did not order, etc.

	    3. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/robert-brugger/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Robert Brugger's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because of the cool concept that they provided, that being the combination of a real time strategy game and a battle royale. I think that I would enjoy the complications and the possibilities behind the project, as there are not many games like it. This game also had a very large scope that I feel could easily be expanded into a great game.<br><br> I chose to reject this proposal because I created a game as my independent study project this last year and I do not think that it would benefit me for the future.

	    4. <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/mason-graham/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Mason Graham's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because of the noticeable benefits to the younger generation that these IQ boosting games would provide. This project as the capability to enhance the learning experience of young children, thus improving the education system as a whole. This project, if performed correctly, could greatly improve attention and grade levels within schools.<br><br> I chose to reject this proposal because I feel like this project has already been done in Cool Math Games and other math, science, social studies, and english websites, so I feel that it would not be desired as much by companies.

	    5. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/soohan-cho/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Soohan Cho's Proposal</a><br>I considered this proposal because it is a unique game genre compared to most of the mainstream games right now. I think it would be quite interesting to work on a game that not many people really consider making.<br><br> I chose to reject this proposal because I do not think it would be difficult considering it is being created in Roblox, a website that provides creators with very easy tools to create maps and functionality. I also do not think that this project would develop applicable skills for the future.

	    6. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/muqadam-sabir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Muqadam Sabir's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because I find the current UI of Skyward to be very inconvenient because of the many design flaws and lack of flow within the website. I think that improving the UI could lead to a happier and more productive student base.<br><br> I chose to reject this website as all that is going to happen is a change in the UI design. There will only be changes to HTML and CSS which will not really benefit me too much as I already have a base in html and css. Another reason that I am rejecting this is I believe it would be too easy considering the very large amount of time that we have been given to complete our ISP's.

	    7. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/pranav-krishnan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Pranav Krishnan's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal as I feel that it would be very beneficial to areas that are heavily affected by climate. I think that this project would greatly aid the population in escaping bad situations when certain dangers such as hurricanes, wildfires, or even tornadoes come around. I feel like this project would be heavily desired by companies, especially in areas that are sesceptible to weather disasters, and the government.<br><br> I chose to reject this project as I feel that it would be very difficult to create as every weather disaster is unique in its own destruction, and it would be nearly impossible to pinpoint exactly what would be perfect for aiding the individuals as every weather hazard is unpredictable.

	    8. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/jakob-mcpherson/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Jakob Mcpherson's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because it would be very beneficial to the computer science profession. This project would allow for beginners to effectively start learning about how machine learning works and how to use it. I think that this project would be very beneficial to companies and would actually provide a lot of income because of the lack of coverage over certain topics that this project works on.<br><br> Although this project is a standout project to me, I chose to reject it because of the issue that a person might not actually be able to create their own nueral network because the AI is already improving and taking control during the tests, similar to AI Sentience.

	    9. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">William Clymire's Proposal</a><br> I considered this proposal because I find it to be a fun and unique project. I think that this project would be very helpful to me in my own personal life as it would most likely improve my productivity, especially in work that I do not want to do. Because this project also keeps their target awake, it could also be utilized in different industries, for example truck driving, although it would need some modifications so that it doesn't cause unwanted trouble on the road.<br><br> I chose to reject this project because although very practical when it comes to getting things done, the only issue is that the productivity relies solely on a persons integrity when it comes to actually turning the product on and using it, because who wants to get tased while they are doing work.

	    10. <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/oliver-hankins/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Oliver Hankins' Proposal</a><br>  Although possibly biased because this is my own groups proposal, I feel as if this project is very innovative and practical in the school environment as it doesn't require any real operation or distribution. A person simply walks into a classroom and bam, their attendance is filled out for the period. I feel like this project would also save a lot of class time at the start of class because it takes away the teacher's responsibility of taking role, ultimately giving a teacher a little more wiggle-room when creating a lesson plan. And keep in mind the fact that this project would minimize attendance mistakes because of the incredible facial recognition and comparison software available to the world right now.<br><br> I chose to accept this project because of the practical uses and improved education that it can bring to the school system in the long run.
