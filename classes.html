	  <p class="classesText">Over the course of my high school career so far, I have taken 9 AP Courses and a handful of advanced courses. The AP courses that I have taken include: AP World History, AP US History, AP Physics 1, AP English 3, AP Literature, AP Physics C, AP Calculus BC, AP Government, and AP Macroeconomics. And among the advanced classes, I have taken advanced high school level Math, English, Science, and Social Studies classes along with taking Computer Science 1, 2, and 3. Throughout all of these classes I have had quite the work-load. The 3 in particular that have given me the most trouble are: AP World and US History, and Computer Science 1-3. Those classes were tough. Getting home after a full day of school and tennis practice only to sit at my desk and work for hours on end writing notes for history and coding Computer Science projects all at the same time. Enough with all of my classes, lets talk about Computer science. In computer Science I've come a long way. Back in CS 1 I could barely code and always needed help no matter what the assignment was. But, I have come a long way because of all that my teacher Mr. Ben-Yaakov has put me through. The constant projects including: a Pong game, a Sudoku game, an Island Survival game, and even coding a mock scheduling application for the entirety of the high school to use. There are many more projects to come in my 3rd and final year of Computer Science at Allen High School. I've come a long way because of how much I have been pushed to work harder than ever in the class. Overall, Computer Science for me wasn't just about the coding of the projects and the suffering from the endless workloads that I would bring home after a tennis match; Computer Science was about the learning of my capabilities and the enjoyment of the processes of critical thinking.</p>
