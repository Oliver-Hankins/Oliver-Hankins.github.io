	  <p class="pastISPText">Over this past year, my favorite project was my team's Island Survival Game. Our game,"Greed Island", was a top-down survival video game in which a player was tasked with facing the hostilities of nature and finding a way to the docked boat on the other side of the map in order to escape off of the island. The game was called 'Greed Island' because of the treasure scattered along the island that allowed for the player to upgrade their gear and fight the continuous flow of hostile monsters that kept on getting stronger as long as the player was still on the island.</p>
